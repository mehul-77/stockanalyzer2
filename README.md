Stock Sentiment Analysis & Prediction
A Machine Learning Approach to Financial Market Predictions
Overview
This project analyzes financial news sentiment and its impact on stock market movements. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning models, and financial data analysis to predict stock price trends based on sentiment extracted from news articles.

Tech Stack
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, ResNL
Data Processing: Sentiment Analysis using FinBERT, Correlation Analysis (Pearson & Spearman), Feature Scaling (Min-Max Normalization)
Web App: Streamlit for interactive visualization
Database & APIs: Google News RSS for real-time news data

Key Features
✅ News Sentiment Analysis: Extracts sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) from financial news using FinBERT.
✅ Stock Market Prediction: Uses machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, ResNL) to predict stock trends.
✅ Data Preprocessing & Imputation: Handles missing data, normalizes values, and analyzes correlation.
✅ Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit to visualize stock trends, sentiment scores, and predictions.
✅ Real-time Data Fetching: Utilizes Google News RSS for live financial news updates.

Future Improvements
🚀 Enhancing model accuracy by incorporating domain-specific sentiment models.
📊 Adding more financial indicators like volatility, trading volume, and macroeconomic factors.
🔍 Experimenting with transformers for better NLP-based sentiment analysis.
